# Messaging vs HTTP: A Benchmark in .NET Microservices

This project benchmarks and compares **direct HTTP request/response** with **message-based communication using MassTransit and RabbitMQ** in a microservices environment using .NET 8.

While messaging is typically recommended for commands and state-changing operations, this benchmark focuses on a common but overlooked case: **read-only queries**, such as `GET /orders`. The goal is to evaluate performance trade-offs and challenge the assumption that messaging is always "too heavy" for simple scenarios.

## What's Included

- Two communication approaches:
  - `DirectHttp`: Uses `HttpClient` between services
  - `Messaging`: Uses `MassTransit` over RabbitMQ for request/response
- Six benchmark scenarios:
  - `baseline_http`, `baseline_messaging`
  - `highload_http`, `highload_messaging`
  - `largepayload_http`, `largepayload_messaging`
- Benchmarks executed using [Grafana k6](https://k6.io/)
- Automated benchmarking scripts with output in Markdown and HTML reports
